Bundle-Description: JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data
  interchange format.        See http://www.JSON.org/        The files
  in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.        It 
 also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP   
      headers, Cookies, and CDL.        This is a reference implementa
 tion. There are a large number of JSON packages        in Java. Perha
 ps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until        t
 hen, choose carefully.
